## Impostor Syndrome

I am privileged because.... <- what is this? Why do we need to add disclaimers?

Because being transgender is such a big deal, and trying typically
gendered things is frowned upon, it feels so important to "get it
right" or not be wrong. And that puts a lot of pressure on us.

And once you start accepting and coming out, the impostor syndrome can
kick in. And it can manifest itself in many different ways. For me, it
was mostly about being sure and about not being pretty enough or able
to pass.





    The impostor cycle
    The need to be special or the best
    Characteristics of superman/superwoman
    Fear of failure
    Denial of ability and discounting praise
    Feeling fear and guilt about success

Perfectionism is a trait that is believed to have a marked impact on
the development and maintenance of impostor fears. Kets de Vries (2005)
asserted that perfectionism is the underlying cause of Neurotic Imposture.
Impostors set “excessively high, unrealistic goals and then experience self-
defeating thoughts and behaviors when they can’t reach those goals” (Kets
de Vries, 2005, p. 112). Within the clinical literature on the Impostor
Phenomenon, perfectionism is repeatedly discussed as a dominant theme,
with Impostors setting extremely high and often unrealistic standards for
their self-evaluation (Imes & Clance, 1984). The need to be the best, the
need to be able to do everything flawlessly and their tendency to overwork
are the characteristics of Impostors that are consistent with the pursuit of
perfection. Impostors’ tendency to discount positive feedback and maintain
high standards for self-evaluation, while being critical of their inability to
realise these standards could also be considered consistent with
perfectionism.

Thompson, Davis, and Davidson (1998) found perfectionistic cognitions in subjects
reporting high levels of impostor fears, such as a tendency to externalise
success, holding high standards for self-evaluation, overgeneralisation of a
single failure experience to their overall self-concept, and a high level of
self-criticism. Thompson, Foreman, and Martin (2000) compared Impostors
and non-Impostors in their affective and cognitive reactions to making
mistakes; they found that Impostors reported a higher concern about their
mistakes and a greater tendency to overestimate the number of mistakes they
had made than non-Impostors. In addition, Impostors also reported greater
dissatisfaction with their performance and viewed their performance as less
successful than non-Impostors. These findings provided empirical support
for the observations of Clance (1985) that Impostors reject any performance
that does not reach their perfect standard and consider their performance as
disappointing.

They also strived to conceal their imperfection by
not engaging in situations when they were likely to reveal their personal
limitations to others. Impostors do not want to appear imperfect and
actively attempt to conceal their imperfection, but paradoxically Impostors
do openly disclose their imperfection to others

Impostors can be viewed as self-presentational strategies used to avoid
negative interpersonal implications of potential failure by engaging in self-
deprecating behaviours, such as discounting praise and positive feedback or
denying that they are as competent as others believe.

A study by Cromwell, Brown, Sanchez-Huceles, and Adair (1990)
found Impostors are different from non-Impostors in that Impostors feel they
need to achieve perfection in order to gain others’ approval. This suggested
that there may be social components contributing to perfectionism in
Impostors. This is because Impostors fear being exposed to others as
fraudulent and lacking in ability and attracting negative judgments from
others. Thompson et al. (2000) found that Impostors have a higher level of
fear of negative evaluation than non-Impostors and the motive behind their
achievement behaviour is to meet their perception of other people’s
standards. These perceived social expectations may be a source of
perfectionism in Impostors, which could be identified as socially prescribed
perfectionism.

How did you get to have this impostor syndrome? What kind of feedback
did you get to get here? Did other people tell you you're not good
enough? Etc.
