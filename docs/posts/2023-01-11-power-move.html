<p>I am privileged because.... &lt;- what is this? Why do we need to add
disclaimers? <a href="https://dmalashock.com/coming-out-as-nonbinary/"
class="uri">https://dmalashock.com/coming-out-as-nonbinary/</a></p>
<p>Because being transgender is such a big deal, and trying typically
gendered things is frowned upon, it feels so important to "get it right"
or not be wrong. And that puts a lot of pressure on us.</p>
<p>And once you start accepting and coming out, the impostor syndrome
can kick in. And it can manifest itself in many different ways. For me,
it was mostly about being sure and about not being pretty enough or able
to pass.</p>
<pre><code>The impostor cycle
The need to be special or the best
Characteristics of superman/superwoman
Fear of failure
Denial of ability and discounting praise
Feeling fear and guilt about success</code></pre>
<p>Perfectionism is a trait that is believed to have a marked impact on
the development and maintenance of impostor fears. Kets de Vries (2005)
asserted that perfectionism is the underlying cause of Neurotic
Imposture. Impostors set “excessively high, unrealistic goals and then
experience self- defeating thoughts and behaviors when they can’t reach
those goals” (Kets de Vries, 2005, p. 112). Within the clinical
literature on the Impostor Phenomenon, perfectionism is repeatedly
discussed as a dominant theme, with Impostors setting extremely high and
often unrealistic standards for their self-evaluation (Imes &amp;
Clance, 1984). The need to be the best, the need to be able to do
everything flawlessly and their tendency to overwork are the
characteristics of Impostors that are consistent with the pursuit of
perfection. Impostors’ tendency to discount positive feedback and
maintain high standards for self-evaluation, while being critical of
their inability to realise these standards could also be considered
consistent with perfectionism.</p>
<p>Thompson, Davis, and Davidson (1998) found perfectionistic cognitions
in subjects reporting high levels of impostor fears, such as a tendency
to externalise success, holding high standards for self-evaluation,
overgeneralisation of a single failure experience to their overall
self-concept, and a high level of self-criticism. Thompson, Foreman, and
Martin (2000) compared Impostors and non-Impostors in their affective
and cognitive reactions to making mistakes; they found that Impostors
reported a higher concern about their mistakes and a greater tendency to
overestimate the number of mistakes they had made than non-Impostors. In
addition, Impostors also reported greater dissatisfaction with their
performance and viewed their performance as less successful than
non-Impostors. These findings provided empirical support for the
observations of Clance (1985) that Impostors reject any performance that
does not reach their perfect standard and consider their performance as
disappointing.</p>
<p>They also strived to conceal their imperfection by not engaging in
situations when they were likely to reveal their personal limitations to
others. Impostors do not want to appear imperfect and actively attempt
to conceal their imperfection, but paradoxically Impostors do openly
disclose their imperfection to others</p>
<p>Impostors can be viewed as self-presentational strategies used to
avoid negative interpersonal implications of potential failure by
engaging in self- deprecating behaviours, such as discounting praise and
positive feedback or denying that they are as competent as others
believe.</p>
<p>A study by Cromwell, Brown, Sanchez-Huceles, and Adair (1990) found
Impostors are different from non-Impostors in that Impostors feel they
need to achieve perfection in order to gain others’ approval. This
suggested that there may be social components contributing to
perfectionism in Impostors. This is because Impostors fear being exposed
to others as fraudulent and lacking in ability and attracting negative
judgments from others. Thompson et al. (2000) found that Impostors have
a higher level of fear of negative evaluation than non-Impostors and the
motive behind their achievement behaviour is to meet their perception of
other people’s standards. These perceived social expectations may be a
source of perfectionism in Impostors, which could be identified as
socially prescribed perfectionism.</p>
<p>How did you get to have this impostor syndrome? What kind of feedback
did you get to get here? Did other people tell you you're not good
enough? Etc.</p>
